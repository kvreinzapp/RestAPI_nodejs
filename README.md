# RestAPI_nodejs

A simple RESTful API built with Node.js, designed as a boilerplate or starting point for backend projects. This project demonstrates how to set up a Node.js server with REST endpoints, focusing on clarity and best practices.

## Features

- Built with pure JavaScript (Node.js)
- RESTful API structure
- Easy to extend and customize
- Clear project structure
- Ready for integration with databases and authentication

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kvreinzapp/RestAPI_nodejs.git
   cd RestAPI_nodejs
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the API

Start the server with:

```bash
npm start
```

The API will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default. You can change the port in your configuration.

## API Endpoints

Below are example endpoints you might find in this project:

| Method | Endpoint        | Description              |
|--------|----------------|--------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/items`   | Get all items            |
| GET    | `/api/items/:id` | Get an item by ID        |
| POST   | `/api/items`   | Create a new item        |
| PUT    | `/api/items/:id` | Update an item           |
| DELETE | `/api/items/:id` | Delete an item           |

> _Update this table according to your actual endpoints and logic._
